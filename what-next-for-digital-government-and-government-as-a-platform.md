# What next for digital government and government as a platform?

GDS is thinking about its strategy for 2025-30. I’m Head of Product in the Digital Service Platforms part of GDS - you might have previously known it as ‘Government as a Platform’, or ‘GaaP’. I’m having some conversations with my SMT colleagues and other well-wishers, and wanted to share some early thoughts-in-progress to elicit feedback from the many excellent thinkers on digital government.

## Where have we come from? 

GDS started by bringing together hundreds of disparate government websites into a single domain, with a vastly improved user experience, overhauling content and a number of key transactional services. 

To help scale the transformation of government services, and drawing on the insight of all of this work, GDS then created Government as a Platform - a set of platforms and components that teams across government could use to build and run services (e.g. GOV.UK Pay, GOV.UK Notify, GovWifi, Registers, Performance Platform and Platform as a Service). These platforms are focused on doing one thing, and doing it really well. In addition to this, GDS bundled the design and frontend insights gained from its partnerships with departmental service teams into the GOV.UK Design System, GOV.UK Prototype Kit and GOV.UK Frontend. Taken together, these platform products meant that services across government now had easy access, without procurement or financial difficulty, to most of the building blocks needed to create services.

At first these platforms were mostly focused on helping teams who already had access to technical capability, as shown by the excellent APIs and developer documentation of these products. But in recent years, these platforms have been expanding into helping teams with less access to technical skills - for example [Pay’s payment links feature](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/). These building blocks can be used by large or small services, and the explosive growth of adoption during covid was testament to the quality of what GDS built.

These are large-scale platforms: each week Pay processes around £30m and Notify sends around 13 million emails, 14 million text messages, and 200,000 letters; the Design System is used on thousands of services.

Building centrally and reusing widely is incredibly economically efficient, with a massive return on investment. Notify is projected to save the taxpayer £63 million this financial year, and the Design System £38 million. As we widen the range of services that we can serve, the potential benefits increase further still.

## What’s happening now?

We’re growing adoption of our existing platform products year-on year. And we’re adding to our set of products by building [GOV.UK Forms](https://www.forms.service.gov.uk/). Currently in private beta, this product addresses a big need that our platform products weren’t previously serving, by allowing services to collect information from users.

Adding Forms also lets us start to change the nature of our platform offering. Up until now, if a government user has wanted to create a service using our components, they’ve had to stitch them together themselves, and think about hosting, technical integration, and end-to-end service design. Because what we offer is a set of tightly-scoped individual components, adopting one of our products doesn’t help you at all in adopting any of our other products, or in making a whole service.

Forms gives us a chance to change this. Last summer we carried out research that suggested that there’s value in a more joined-up offering that can be used by teams without access to technical capability - but we want to test demand and value in practice. So in Q3 this year we’ve integrated Forms with Notify in a very basic way, and in Q4 we will be integrating Forms with Pay in a very basic way. We’ll use these integrations to test the demand for - and value of - a more joined-up offering. This quiet expansion of our Forms product amounts to an MVP of an integrated Digital Service Platform.

If this work continues to go well, in 24/5 we’ll build on this, progressing towards a platform offering that can either be consumed as individual components parts, or adopted as a whole, without users having to worry about integration, hosting, or any of what’s going on behind the scenes. Ultimately, we want to make it as easy as possible for government to build and run great services for the public, whatever the service team’s size, shape, budget and capabilities. 

Helping teams without access to technical skills to transform their service allows us to uncover an extra layer of service transformation across government. This is the next step in the government as a platform vision, going from providing platform components to providing an easy-to-adopt platform that helps build and run the whole service.

With even small, simple services often costing hundreds of thousands of pounds (or more) a year to run, helping the thousands of non-transformed services fully digitise has economic potential in the hundreds of millions of pounds, even with a pessimistic estimate of the percentage of services that would be impacted.

Looking across to the rest of GDS, GOV.UK is soon to start [building a native app](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2023/06/06/putting-growth-at-the-heart-of-gov-uks-strategy/), with a particular interest in young people, alongside its web estate, and Digital Identity are nearing important adoption milestones with some key departments and services.

## Where is GDS going next?

This work across GDS should set the foundations for where we go next, from 2025 to 2030.

We want to deliver the public a smoother, more proactive and personalised experience of interacting with government. Working back from this target experience, much of the work ahead is clear, and is largely about catching up to what users already expect from digital services. Data sharing across services, where users consent, to reduce effort and friction, better control of the communication experience, the understanding and anticipation of user circumstances and needs to drive proactive action to help people when they need it, without them having to be experts in government; all underpinned by a smooth, secure and ubiquitous way to prove your identity. This will take a lot of work.

## What's the strategy for delivering this at scale?

This desired future requires two waves of transformation - taking what currently exists to a higher degree of interconnected sophistication, and getting the current long tail of 9,000 non-transformed document-driven services (PDFs or otherwise) up to this standard.

Hand-crafting all of this transformation would be slow and ruinously expensive, and the ongoing operational costs of a bespoke approach would be prohibitive. Public finances will continue to be under pressure, and government will need and expect rapid deployment of policy into service provision. So the 2025 to 2030 transformation needs to be powered by platforms, to allow it to happen fast, in a cost-effective and high-quality way.

Alongside this, we have an opportunity to be ambitious about our vision for the future of government services. We can think about emerging capabilities and their trajectory, and make some confident bets on the future. This helps us to go beyond just catching up to where we should already be, and to focus on a future-facing transformation of government services.

## The next step for government as a platform is a service transformation engine

The next step for government as a platform is a service transformation engine that uses AI and data to drive the delivery of great experiences across all services, and continuously optimise them.

The Digital Service Platforms programme’s work on a joined-up service platform will, by the end of 24/5, allow government to quickly and effectively create whole services, whatever the service team’s access to technical skills.. 

From there, we’ll be able to take the next step and orient government’s platform offering to helping people create great services, and powering government-wide continuous service transformation, harnessing the power of network effects, data and artificial intelligence. We will do this by empowering service teams to make great design decisions upfront, and through data- and AI-driven improvement to individual services and all services on our platform over time.


## We will empower teams to make great design decisions when building digital services

We will use AI, the GDS Design System, and Government Design Principles.

If our first shift is to go beyond empowering technical specialists to empowering service teams who don’t have access to technical specialists, our second shift is to empower teams who do not have access to service and digital design expertise. This is how we reach the long tail of thousands of government PDF forms.

Artificial intelligence capabilities are improving rapidly. AI can already be used to check content against a style guide, check the reading age of a document, or suggest alternatives to jargon. Soon we will be able to harness AI to help people make better decisions when designing and creating services and their associated content, particularly when we power it with an understanding of our Design System and Government Design Principles.

As these capabilities continue to mature, we’ll be able to help government design and build better services from the start - improving policy formation and service design. There’s an opportunity here to collaborate with CDDO on empowering policy colleagues to more effectively transmit policy into reality.

Design decisions over the next 5 years will become harder rather than easier. Service interactions will likely be increasingly mediated through AI agents and through more personalised or multimodal interaction patterns rather than flat HTML pages. Designing for these interactions, and distilling best practice into readily available components, will be a key role for GDS. Similarly, trust will become increasingly scarce, and we’ll need to design for the retention and reinforcement of trust in government in ways that go beyond the visual recognition of the GOV.UK Design System and GOV.UK Frontend library. 

The Design System will broaden out from being a pattern library for components, and move into setting guidance for apps, operational design, policy design, service design and AI interaction surfaces. Cybersecurity threats will increase, and we’ll need to empower people to build services with great cybersecurity, whatever their level of access to technical and cyber expertise. There’s lots of cross-GDS collaborative work to be done to make this happen, with Digital Service Platforms partnering closely with Digital Identity and GOV.UK on this integrated service platform for government.

Taken together, this work sees us move from empowering technical specialists (the first years of the GaaP programme), through to empowering digital and design specialists without access to technical skills (the current work of the Digital Service Platforms programme), and into empowering policy and operational colleagues, so that we can transform all government services. Better policy and better design to make better services for everyone.

But making better design decisions when creating a service is only the start. We need to help government services improve over time.

## We will drive perpetual improvement to individual services, and to the wider service platform

We will achieve this by harnessing data and artificial intelligence and applying it to the GDS service platform.

Digital government in the UK has never had good insight into how well services are performing. GOV.UK is working hard to address some of this, joining up the disconnect of service data between www.gov.uk (where the content lives) and services.gov.uk (where the services live) through the [Single Data Environment](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2022/10/17/the-single-data-environment-joined-up-digital-analytics/). This will start to build a foundation of data on how users interact with services and where they have problems, and it will allow individual parts of bigger services to get a joined up view of the bigger picture.

This joined-up performance data, combined with analytics (that we’ll bake in to the joined-up Digital Service Platform) and insights from written user feedback data (that we’ll collect and analyse through AI for all services on the Digital Service Platform), will allow us to see how well a service is performing, and how it might be improved. 

We’ll be able to identify good services and bad services, and suggest improvements to bad services to help them improve outcomes and user experience, based on the [Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles) and the concrete evidence of good services on the platform. For example: “This step of your service is having problems. We think it’s because you have too many options on your form and because they aren’t clearly expressed. Based on insights from the best services, we suggest that you halve the number of options and change the wording in these specific ways to improve your service...” The next stage from this will be to suggest service improvements and enact them automatically (subject to oversight and approval by the service owner).

(diagram)

So every service on the joined-up Digital Service Platform will benefit from continuous data- and insight-driven optimisation. We’ll surface this insight to the public and policymakers, improving scrutiny and decision-making. This will empower government and enable scrutiny by the public.

These insights won’t just be used to drive improvements to individual services: they’ll feed back in to components and guidance, so that the platform as a whole - and all the services on it - becomes better at meeting user needs over time. 

This is where we harness network effects. At the moment we don’t really make use of the benefits of having so many services using our products. In the next 5 years we’ll change this, and use the scale of government digital delivery to help improve the quality of digital services over time.

## The opportunity ahead

The years 2025 to 2030 offer the prospect of all 9,000 government services being truly digitised, through a government-wide Digital Service Platform. More than this, they offer the prospect of these services being better designed, and improving over time - not just individually, but as an interlocking ecosystem that learns and strengthens together, to keep doing an ever-better job of serving user needs across all government services. This strategy builds on what government as a platform has accomplished up to this date, and uses newly-emerging capabilities, whilst harnessing the breadth, diversity and scale of government. This is GDS’s opportunity to drive the next stage of digital government, and for the UK to regain its international leadership in this space.
