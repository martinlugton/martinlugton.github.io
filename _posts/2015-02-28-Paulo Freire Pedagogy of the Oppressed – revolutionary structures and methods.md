*This is a set of quotes summarising Paulo Freire’s thoughts on 
the structures and methods needed for genuine revolution, taken from The
 Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1996 Penguin Edition).*

### Appropriate revolutionary structures and methods

#### Who is a radical?

“What distinguishes revolutionary leaders from the dominant elite is not only their objectives, but their procedures.” (148)

“trusting the people is the indispensable precondition for revolutionary change.” (42)

“The radical… does not consider himself or herself the proprietor of 
history or of all people, or the liberator of the oppressed; but he her 
she does commit himself or herself, within history, to fight at their 
side.” (21)

“The man or woman who proclaims devotion to the cause of liberation yet is unable to enter *communion*
 with the people, whom he or she continues to regard as totally 
ignorant, is grievously self-deceived.” (43) (What happened in early 
c20th Russia, with ‘going to the people’?)

“it is necessary to trust in the oppressed and in their ability to 
reason. Whoever lacks this trust will fail to initiate (or will abandon)
 dialogue, reflection, and communication, and will fall into using 
slogans, communiqués, monologues, and instructions.” (48)

“constant, humble, and courageous witness emerging from cooperation 
in a shared effort – the liberation of women and men – avoids the danger
 of antidialogical control.” (157)

“The essential elements of witness which do not vary historically include: *consistency* between words and actions; *boldness* which urges the witnesses to confront existence as a permanent risk; *radicalization* (not sectarianism) leading both the witnesses and the ones receiving that witness to increasing action; *courage to love*
 (which, far from being accommodation to an unjust world, is rather the 
transformation of that world in behalf of the increasing liberation of 
humankind); and *faith* in the people,…” (157)

“Instead of following predetermined plans, leaders and people, 
mutually identified, together create the guidelines of their action.” 
(162)

“if at a given historical moment the basic aspiration of the people 
goes no further than a demand for salary increases, the leaders can 
commit one of two errors. They can limit their action to stimulating 
this one demand or they can overrule this popular aspiration and 
substitute something more far-reaching – but something which has not yet
 come to the forefront of the people’s attention. In the first case, the
 revolutionary leaders follow a line of adaptation to the people’s 
demands. In the second case, by disrespecting the aspirations of the 
people, they fall into cultural invasion. the solution lies in 
synthesis: the leaders must on the one hand identify with the people’s 
demand for higher salaries, while on the other they must pose the 
meaning of that very demand as a problem. By doing this, the leaders 
pose a as a problem a real, concrete, historical situation of which the 
salary demand is one dimension. It will thereby become clear that salary
 demands alone cannot comprise a definitive solution.” (163-4)

#### Emancipation cannot be imposed

“the great humanistic and historical task of the oppressed: to liberate themselves and their oppressors as well.” (26)

“Freedom is acquired by conquest, not by gift.” (29)

“The correct method for a revolutionary leadership to employ in the task of liberation is, therefore, *not*
 ‘libertarian propaganda.’ … The correct method lies in dialogue. The 
conviction of the oppressed that they must fight for their liberation is
 not a gift bestowed by the revolutionary leadership, but the result of 
their own *conscientização*.” (49)

“The struggle begins with men’s recognition that they have been 
destroyed. Propaganda, management, manipulation – all arms of domination
 cannot be the instruments of their rehumanization. The only effective 
instrument is a humanizing pedagogy in which the revolutionary 
leadership establishes a permanent relationship of dialogue with the 
oppressed.” (50)

“The revolutionary’s role is to liberate, and be liberated, with the people – not to win them over.” (76)

“Revolutionary leaders cannot think *without* the people, nor *for* the people, but only *with* the people.” (112)

### On charity and deference

“Any attempt to ‘soften’ the power of the oppressor in deference to 
the weakness of the oppressed almost always manifests itself in the form
 of false generosity; indeed, the attempt never goes beyond this. In 
order to have the continued opportunity to express their ‘generosity,’ 
the oppressors must perpetuate injustice as well. An unjust social order
 is the permanent fount of this ‘generosity,’ which is nourished by 
death, despair, and poverty. That is why the dispensers of false 
generosity become desperate at the slightest threat to its source.”(26)

“True generosity consists precisely in fighting to destroy the causes
 which nourish false charity. False charity constrains the fearful and 
subdued, the ‘rejects of life,’ to extend their trembling hands. True 
generosity lies in striving so that these hands – whether of individuals
 or entire peoples – need to be extended less and less in supplication, 
so that more and more they become human hands which work and, working, 
transform the world.” (27)

#### I think this is a useful observation for the UK Labour Party

“In a situation of manipulation, the Left is almost always tempted by
 a ‘quick return to power,’ forgets the necessity of joining with the 
oppressed to forge an organization, and strays into an impossible 
‘dialogue’ with the dominant elites. It ends up being manipulated by 
these elites, and not infrequently itself falls into an elitist game, 
which it calls ‘realism’.” (130)
