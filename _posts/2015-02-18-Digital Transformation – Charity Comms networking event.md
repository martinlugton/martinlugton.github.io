*“What does it actually mean, and what does it look like for your charity?” This post is a quick summary of the most interesting ideas that came up in discussion at this Heads of Digital networking event, 15 March 2017. The event was held under the Chatham House Rule, so I won’t be sharing anything identifiable.*

Upskilling everyone equally might not be as useful as significantly upskilling some key individuals.  
Build a community of product owners, train them and empower them through management of their own backlog and budget.

Digital transformation sees digital outgrow its regular home in communications and move into:

- Service delivery
- Business transformation
- Making sure that the organization meets user needs.
- Foundational business processes and infrastructure.

Don’t be proscriptive with change. Instead, invite teams to let you know where you might be able to help them achieve their goals more effectively with digital tools.

If you start by optimising a small number of key user journeys, this can give you a clear way in.  
Follow this thread towards transformation. The necessary changes emerge organically, and it’s easier than getting buy-in upfront.
