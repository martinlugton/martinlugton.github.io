I work in tech for good and digital government. I'm Head of Product for [Digital Service Platforms](https://platforms.service.gov.uk/) at the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service).

I enjoy both launching new products and the challenges of driving value from established, large-scale products.

Some recent highlights include:
- launching [GOV.UK Forms](https://www.forms.service.gov.uk/) into beta, and growing it from 0 services to over 200
- growing [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) at a record pace (for example, onboarding 232 new services in March 2025) using a product-led growth model, whilst achieving the highest ever user satisfaction (88%)
- securing 3 billion pieces of PPE for the UK during covid
- helping boost staff satisfaction and trust in leadership in my deputy-directorate at GDS

I have deep technical and product insight, backed by strong brainpower and curiosity. I'm energising and positive, and create psychological safety and clarity of intent. These strong foundations allow me to lead teams to achieve great outcomes.
