*Hereâ€™s a 10 tweet summary of last nightâ€™s NFP Tweetup. I wasnâ€™t actually able to attend the event, but thatâ€™s no barrier to summarising the best material from twitter ðŸ™‚*

### Innovation and failure â€“ Luke Williams, RNLI

Set up organisation-spanning structures to keep an eye on trends:

> .[@RNLI](https://twitter.com/RNLI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) have a 'future trends' group to look 5-10 yrs into the future: digital currency, drones, IoT etc [#NFPtweetup](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFPtweetup?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Formal approval processes often take longer than tech implementation work:

**How to decide whether to jump a trend:**

- Where is this trend in its lifecycle? Has it peaked? Which other organisations have taken part?
- Can we relate it to our organisation?
- What time/resources do we need to make it happen?
- How do we make it authentic to the trend?
- Does taking part present any risks?

### Writing a digital brief â€“ Jonty Sharples, Hactar

Headline structure for a digital brief:

Start with the user need and then think about the product. Not the other way round.

### Digital Transformation approaches and language â€“ Joe Freeman, Breast Cancer Now

Some resources on transformation recommended by Joe:

- [My love-hate relationship with the term digital transformation](https://medium.com/@lucia_adams/my-love-hate-relationship-with-the-term-digital-transformation-db27bec0cde#.ss65flj3r)

Digital transformation is mostly about culture and ways of working, not technology
