# Agile innovation in income generation for charities

Innovation in income generation – NFP Tweetup 19, 11 July 2013 – in 10 tweets.

This tweetup was actually focused more on ways of working than on income generation, and agile methodology was the big discussion point.

## The PlumpyNut Challenge: making earned media work for fundraising – Deniz Hassan, Digital Marketing Manager at Merlin

> We wanted to have fun with brand. We’ve spent 10 years sending photos of sad children to people and it’s not working anymore [#nfptweetup](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nfptweetup)

Merlin took a strategic move – no ‘sad Christmas campaign’. Went for a positive fr campaign in the new year [#nfptweetup](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nfptweetup)

Took a more low-fi, playful approach to content-creation. Shamelessly reached out to celebrities on twitter to encourage them to share the message.

> £6k cost for Merlin’s Twitter campaign earned £40k in donations, 500 new supporters and millions of impressions: not too shabby [#nfptweetup](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nfptweetup)

## Task Squad: Developing a self-sustaining commercial enterprise, by Sam Sparrow, Knowledge and Innovation Manager, and Damien Austin-Walker, Head of Digital, at Vinspired

Most recruitment consultants aren’t doing a great job of finding work for young people without experience, so it’s interesting to see Vinspired take the initiative here.

[Task Squad](http://tasksquadhq.com/) “Post paid tasks, corporate errands and temporary jobs to a community of over 100,000 young people eager to get into the job market.”

This session was an interesting summary of Vinspired’s creation of a spin off micro-recruitment business. Good discussion around agile ways of working and how this can minimise risks, improve focus on objectives, and enhance organisational ways of working through better collaboration.

> Lean, agile development process – start small and test! Less risk and easier for SMT to swallow if it fails! [#nfptweetup](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nfptweetup)

> Test the concept before you build _anything_ [#nfptweetup](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nfptweetup)

> You learn as you implement. Very good point, you never stop learning when developing in start up mode. [#NFPTweetup](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NFPTweetup)

## Just Giving’s ways of working, by @annanthem

This slot continued the discussion of agile methodology, by looking at JustGiving’s processes.

I’m wary of using terms without pointing people to their origin, so I tweeted out a link to the agile manifesto.

> Wondering what ‘agile’ is all about? Start with the v short agile manifesto [ow.ly/1Z4oG2](http://ow.ly/1Z4oG2) [#nfptweetup](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nfptweetup)

> “We don’t care who reports to who – we can’t afford to.” Nice. [#NFPtweetup](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NFPtweetup)

> Systematically taking down any barriers to co-creation that we find – [@justgiving](https://twitter.com/justgiving) [#nfptweetup](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nfptweetup)

> “We work out the ‘why’ of everything. Then, obsessively measure, and measure again” says [@annanthem](https://twitter.com/annanthem) [#NFPTweetup](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NFPTweetup)
