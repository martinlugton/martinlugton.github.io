# Video – a 10 tweet summary of NFP tweetup 27

A discussion of film and video in the charity sector.

Featuring “The power of supporter-focused video to drive fundraising” – Francis Mason and Rebecca Highfield, Anthony Nolan; “Delivering for public health and fundraising? How Breakthrough Breast Cancer did it with TLC” – Matthew Jupe, Breakthrough Breast Cancer; “MyStory: Lessons learnt from delighting users through video content” – Jamie Parkins, JustGiving; and a panel discussion.

## Anthony Nolan – supporter-created video and a brand storytelling video

Great examples of a supporter-created video and a slick brand video:

It’s worth reflecting on what distinguishes these two videos, and what unites them.  
The formal quality of the supporter-created is lower, but it’s clearly good enough.  
The second video is slicker – better film quality, better sound, transitions, and more clearly on-brand.

But the main feature of both videos is strong storytelling. The supporter-created video has an off-the-cuff charm, but it’s also clearly been carefully put together, by a funny and sweet supporter.

Much of the evening was focused on the second type of video – material produced by people working for charities – but I’m very interested in how we can help supporters to create their own content.

## Touch Look Check – Direct Marketing on TV and trains

A promotional campaign asking people to request a guide for the signs to spot breast cancer, with a follow-up direct debit donation ask.

> Oh, sorry, it was about £8 per lead from train panels and £3-3.50 from DRTV [#NFPtweetup](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFPtweetup?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Intriguing that television was the dominant channel in this TLC campaign and that PPC and display weren’t used so much.

## MyStory

A JustGiving project that generated a personalised thank-you video for each London Marathon runner using their platform, and sent it out the day after the event.

> I think we're gonna start seeing a big trend in personalised video. A great way to thank supporters [#nfptweetup](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nfptweetup?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The traffic to MyStory was overwhelmingly from the Facebook mobile app.  
90% of MyStory referral traffic was from Facebook mobile. Only 1% from Facebook desktop. 5% from Twitter mobile.

Interesting to contrast the automated, perhaps slightly sterile, MyStory video generator with the rough-and-ready supporter stories. I guess the personalisation gives these videos credibility.

## Panel discussion

One good point that came up was that it’s not enough to just create some high-quality video: you need to plan how to promote it. And, of course, you need to start with a clear purpose for any video.
