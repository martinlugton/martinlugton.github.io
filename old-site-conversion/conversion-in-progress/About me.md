# About me

Digital technology has massive power to connect people and information in transformative ways. I work in digital because I think it’s the best way I can make a difference to people around me.

Digital is unbounded, chaotic and emergent. It’s a thrilling place to work and live.

I work at the Government Digital Service as Head of Product for our Digital Service Platforms.
