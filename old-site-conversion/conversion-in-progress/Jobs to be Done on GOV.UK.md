A few months ago [Imeh Akpan](https://twitter.com/imeh_akpan) ran a session for GOV.UK Product Managers going over the Jobs to Be Done Framework. She’s been looking into how we might use it to think about our users better.

Jobs to Be Done is about understanding the underlying problem.

What’s the difference between a Job and a Problem that a user has? It adds context: so it includes the fact that someone is driving to work, rather than just being hungry.

This kind of contextual understanding helps you improve your product to better solve some known jobs.

So in the case of selling milkshake to people visiting a fast food restaurant, optimising the product in its own right – making it chunkier or improving the flavour – was missing the point. When the business started solving for the underlying problem – the real ‘job’ the milkshake was being ‘hired’ to carry out – then sales went up.

Jobs to be Done is about user motivations and situations, rather than attributes and characteristics. This is good because those things change, and may not be important. ‘Specialist’ users of GOV.UK are often not very different to ‘Mainstream’ users. I found the same thing at NDCS – the imagined differences between “Professional” and “Parent” users didn’t really hold up to scrutiny.

A Job to be Done is the real world goal that the user hopes to accomplish. It’s not a task – those are the steps that someone takes to accomplish the goal, because they seem like the best way of doing so.

A ‘Job story’ is written in the form:

When [situation]

I want to [motivation]

So I can [expected outcome]

Take a Job and a Job Story, and you have a Job to Be Done. The Job stays the same, as it’s a deep underlying need, but the story and the solution can change over time.
