The world is bad because we made it this way. “The world is designed to work this way.”

When people talk about changing the world, ask: “How? For who?”
For all the excitement about Uber and AirBnB, the service economy is 
nothing new. “There’s nothing disruptive about rich people getting 
richer.”

### How to change the world

1.  **Get ignorant.**

    Realise that the world as designed works in our favour. What if that wasn’t the case?<br>
    The Veil of Ignorance is “The single most important political and ethical concept in a designer’s toolbox.”

2.  **Look like the world.**

    “Our diversity is our strength, and we’re idiots for not leveraging it.”<br>
    If people have narrow life experience, you just get “white boys solving problems for white boys”.<br>
    “They’ve never been harrassed, so it doesn’t even occur to them that that’s a problem you have to solve for.”<br>
    Similarly with cabs refusing to stop, or being assaulted,

    “Empathy is not enough – we need inclusion.”<br>
    The point isn’t that any particular experience or classification makes 
    you a better designer. People are just better informed about themselves 
    than they are about others.<br>
    Our teams need to reflect the diversity of who we design for. It’s not 
    just about race or gender, but experiences, needs, thinking, solutions.

3.  **Design the right thing**

    The AK47 is easy to use, easy to manufacture. But design is about more than this.<br>
    “Nothing who’s primary purpose is to kill can be said to be designed well.”<br>
    “Attempting to separate an object from its function, in order to 
    appreciate it for purely aesthetic reasons, or to be impressed by its 
    minimal elegance is a coward’s way of justifying the death they have 
    brought into the world and the money with which they’re lining their 
    pockets.”

    “Design is a trade done for money, but we have a choice about how we make that money.”<br>
    “Your role as a designer is to leave the world in a better state than you found it.”<br>
    “You are responsible for what you make.”

### There are big design problems for us to solve

* Global warming
* The migrant crisis
* Guns in the US

We’re lucky people – so we’re responsible for helping others who weren’t as lucky.<br>
Change *how* we design and *who* designs.<br>
Use your time on this world in the interest of making others free.
