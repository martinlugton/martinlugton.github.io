This evening a sharp email campaign arrived in my inbox. It’s from [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/), a platform for people to arrange in-person meetups around shared interests.

With talk of New Year’s Resolutions becoming a little tiresome, the one-word subject line “Unresolutions” feels liberating and iconoclastic.

The content of the email is clear and focused:

The body of the email has an intriguing statement and an invitation to positive action, with a deliciously chunky button, leading with the imperative “try”. So of course I clicked on it.

[Great landing page](http://www.meetup.com/2013/?a=un1_btn#outdoor):

Strong visuals, focus on the central image and call to action, with other options invitingly waiting at both sides of the screen. The page covers a good range of options.

I like this campaign – it’s positive, empowering, expansive, exploratory and hopeful. Have you seen a good email campaign recently?
