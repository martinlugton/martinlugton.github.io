# Google announces 2 changes to Google Grants for 28 January 2013

I received an email from Google announcing a couple of changes to the Google Grants programme:

> “We are writing to let you know about a few changes to the Google Grants programme.
>
> As part of our ongoing efforts to grow our advertising programme for 
> nonprofits, we are making two changes to the Grants programme.
>
> First, as of January 28, 2013, Google Grantees may bid up to $2.00 
> USD on keywords. This is an increase from the previous CPC bid cap of 
> $1.00 USD and may allow your ads to enter auctions previously 
> unavailable at the $1.00 bid cap.
>
> Second, to balance the interests of businesses who pay to advertise 
> on Google search, your ads will now appear below the ads of traditional 
> AdWords advertisers.”

The second point here is by far the more important. As I understand it, this means that Google Grant adverts will now appear below all paid adverts.

When operating a business, money talks. But when your business is running a search engine, quality results should talk louder. This quality is the ultimate source of advertising revenue.

I had thought that the way that Google’s AdWord bidding operates – boosting the power of high-quality adverts, so that placement isn’t just determined by the money bid – was a decent compromise. Under the $1 Google Grant cap, some areas were out of reach – particularly for fundraising – but with good quality adverts and content, your $1 could go a long way in some cases.

I’ll be interested to see what impact this change has on the effectiveness of the Google Grant for charities.
