Psychology knows that behaviour is seldom rational. So we need to study behaviour.

### Create a common design language with “nonviolent communication”

Marshall Rosenberg argued that there were 3 categories of non-violent communication:

1. 88 human needs 
2. 91 positive feelings we wish to experience
3. 153 negative feelings we want to avoid

To be non-judgmental, clear and constructive in our use of language, use a “Rosenberg deck” of feelings cards as a conversation prompt.

### Map behaviours with “rational emotive behaviourism”

Albert Ellis, the founder of CBT, argued that Activators trigger Behaviours, which lead to Consequences.

Map out a user journey. Use an Ellis Matrix. Identify the causes of user behaviours. Propose what new Consequences could be, and what new activators and behaviours could be.

### Map motivations with “guiding self ideals”

A lot of what we do is a result of feelings of inferiority. (See the work of Alfred Adler.)  
We seek a “fictional final goal” – if I do [BLANK] I’ll be finished and happy.

So ask ourselves: what would happen to us as an organisation if we never tried to solve this problem?  
What would happen to the user if we never tried to solve this problem?

Then ask: What is an aspirational place for us to be? What if we *did* do this?  
Can you clearly indicate what the result would be? – for us and for users

You need to map this out to get an overview of a potential new area of work.

### Good leaders and designers empower the team

Lao Tzu quote on leadership, from Tao Te Ching:  
“A leader is best when people barely know he exists, not so good when people obey and acclaim him and worse when they despise him. But of a good leader, when his work is done, his aim is fulfilled, they will all say we did it ourselves.”
