# Page load speed of top 10 UK charity brand websites

Visitors like fast websites, and your [digital performance suffers if your site loads slowly](http://www.martinlugton.com/page-load-speed-important-impact-site-speed-conversions-revenue/). How fast are UK charity websites, and which charity has the fastest website?

I’ve surveyed the websites of the top 10 UK charity brands, as identified by the [2014 Charity Brand Index](http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/cancer-research-uk-named-best-charity-brand-2014/communications/article/1309460). From a performance perspective, the ideal is to have a site that loads quickly, and for the amount of downloading required to be as small as possible. So you want a low ‘load time’ and a low ‘page weight’.

Here’s how the sites compare:

- **BBC Children in Need and Comic Relief had the fastest home pages.**
- If you’re commissioning a new website, or want to improve the performance of your existing site, aim to beat the average performance of these sites. **Aim for pages that**:
  - **load in 3.5 seconds or less**
  - **have a page weight of 1.9 MB or less**
- **If your pages load in 2 seconds or under, and if your page weight is 1MB or less, you’re doing very well**.

*This data was obtained by running 4 unthrottled desktop speed tests using [GTMetrix](http://www.gtmetrix.com/) between 16 August and 22 August 2015 and averaging the results. An interesting follow-up would be to look at mobile performance: set a mobile browser and throttle the connection to a common mobile download speed.*
