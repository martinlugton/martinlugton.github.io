# Some user experience information streams I’ve subscribed to today

Today I’ve spent some time reviewing which RSS feeds I subscribe to. I’ve decided that I’m missing out on user experience material. So I’ve been hunting out some streams of UX inspiration and ideas.

I’ve added the following feeds to my RSS subscriptions, and will be reviewing their usefulness over the next couple of months:

- [Smashing Magazine UX design category](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/)  
  Feed address: http://rss1.smashingmagazine.com/feed/?f=uxdesign-std

- [UX Magazine](http://uxmag.com/)  
  Feed address: feed://feeds.uxmag.com/uxm  
  I’m slightly wary of this one – will the content just be stripped down teasers for paid material? Will the focus be too long-form and specific for my needs?

- [Gizmodo’s user experience tag](http://gizmodo.com/tag/user-experience)  
  Feed address: http://gizmodo.com/tag/user-experience/rss  
  This one was a little harder to find the RSS feed for. I didn’t have to do any [filtering like I’ve done with other RSS feeds](http://www.martinlugton.com/filtering-rss-feeds-for-a-more-useful-inbound-content-stream/), but I did need to manually work out the URL. I followed [this guidance](http://gizmodo.com/329925/how-to-subscribe-to-the-best-gizmodo-stories-on-rss) to generate the URL I needed – you just need to put /rss at the end of the tag’s URL.

- [UI Patterns](http://ui-patterns.com/)  
  Feed address: http://feeds.feedburner.com/UI-patterns-com  
  UI design patterns are standard solutions to common design problems. This site discusses them and also collates examples.

- [Elements of design](http://www.smileycat.com/design_elements/)  
  Feed address: http://feeds.feedburner.com/ElementsOfDesign  
  A showcase of different design patterns. The RSS feed itself shows latest additions to the example gallery.
