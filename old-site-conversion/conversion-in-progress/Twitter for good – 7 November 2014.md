# Twitter for good – 7 November 2014

On Friday 7 November, Twitter UK hosted ‘Twitter for Good’ at their London offices.

There was an initial presentation aimed at a broad group, presumably ranging from people who don’t use twitter through to charities making heavy use of the platform. This meant that there was a good range of material explaining and selling the platform as a whole. There were also some good statistics on the behaviour (and, implicitly, value) of twitter users to charities:

## Propensity of twitter users to give

> 96% of UK twitter users have donated to charity this year. 50% follow charities. Of these, 53% have donated after a tweet [#twitterforgood](https://twitter.com/hashtag/twitterforgood?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

> 32% of UK twitter charity followers report an interest in fundraising content [#twitterforgood](https://twitter.com/hashtag/twitterforgood?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Taken together, these figures suggest that the interest in fundraising content is higher if the ask or content is right.

## Importance of mobile

For anyone making the case for a responsive website, there was a great stat on mobile use of twitter:

> 80% of UK twitter users access the platform via mobile [#twitterforgood](https://twitter.com/hashtag/twitterforgood?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

## Twitter cards

Twitter cards can be used for signups too:

> Twitter cards – Eg images, video, sound, lead generation. Can include sign ups for further contact [#twitterforgood](https://twitter.com/hashtag/twitterforgood?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) cc [@Sedom19](https://twitter.com/Sedom19?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

We’re currently thinking about Data Protection, so I wonder how easy it would be to integrate twitter cards into our overall data capture setup.

## This event signals the intent of twitter to deepen engagement with charities

Twitter’s interest is to deepen and extend use of its platform – and, implicitly, to monetise this use. To my surprise, adverts weren’t mentioned at all. I guess growing an engaged user base is the key challenge; advertising comes second.

I’m looking forward to what may happen next. Could twitter operate as a hub for charities sharing best practice, and for condensing and disseminating these practices back to the twitter-using charity community? There’s clear mutual benefit there. Hopefully we’ll see some developments in the new year.
