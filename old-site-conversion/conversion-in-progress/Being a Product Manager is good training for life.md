# Being a Product Manager is good training for life

Being a product manager helps you live a good life:

- You become confident in dealing with different domains of knowledge and different types of truth, and arbitrating between them.
- You can imagine and weigh up possible futures, and sell and fight for the one that seems best.
- You make decisions with imperfect information.
- You lead from the intersection between optimism and pessimism. Seeing how things could be different and better, and helping others believe, but rooting your thinking in understanding of complexity, risk and assumptions.
- You call out the risky assumptions underlying wishful thinking.
- Youâ€™re adventurous and humble and focus on value.
