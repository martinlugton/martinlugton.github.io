# Gamify This! – NFP Tweetup 18

*Here's a summary of NFP Tweetup 18, which focused on gamification.*

1. "Gamification is about taking game mechanics & applying them to real world situations" - @robjones

2. Key game mechanics include: collecting, points, feedback, exchanges, customisation, progressive unlocking #nfptweetup

3. It's about using game design (not just points and badges) to engage people & get them coming back - @robjones #nfptweetup

4. Important that the game mechanics serve a purpose. Not gamification for gamification's sake. #nfptweetup
