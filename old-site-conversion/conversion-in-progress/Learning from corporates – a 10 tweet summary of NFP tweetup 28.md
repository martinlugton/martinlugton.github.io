## Anthony Leung, Social Media Manager at Just Eat

Just Eat base their social strategy on engagement. Reach and audience size arise out of this. Anthony advises against doing things the other way round: focusing on growing follower numbers can be self-defeating as you under-invest in engagement and lose followers in the long-run.

So how do you ensure engagement? Having a clear tone of voice is crucial, so that you avoid being plain and uninteresting.

Donâ€™t ask â€˜What content is right?â€™ Instead, ask â€˜How does my brand behave?â€™

Imagine your brand as a person, and ask:

- What makes them excited, frustrated?
- How does this person speak â€“ funny authoritative?
- How does this person react to subjects that matter to your brand?
- How does this person handle a bad situation?

Decide what behaviour you want to be known for, and encourage this behaviour in your supporters too.

Bringing marketing and customer/supporter care teams closer together allows you to harness the strengths of both. Theyâ€™ll be responsive and on-brand, and youâ€™ll all increase your understanding of your audiences.

## Alex Goldstein â€“ Senior Social Media Manager at TMW

Alex found that the corporate sector has more visible silos, whereas the often under-resourced charity sector tends to require individuals to take on a wider range of tasks. This can be empowering, and help charity sector workers get things done faster, but it can mean that they donâ€™t always have the required expert support. And having to hold all those disciplines in your mind at once can cause confusion.

Broadly speaking, Alex has found that the corporate sector has more money, and is more courageous with risk. The charity sector has better stories and passion.

## Endangered Emoji â€“ Adrian Cockle, Digital Innovation Manager at WWF International

> The campaign was based on the insight that many of the species included in the emoji range are endangered. So why not highlight [#NFPtweetup](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFPtweetup?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

WWF wouldnâ€™t say how much money the campaign raised, but the primary objective was awareness not fundraising.

> I do love this campaign. Tweeting emojis is fun and people did it lots. But we're all waiting to hear if it raised ðŸ’°, right? [#NFPtweetup](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFPtweetup?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Adrian summarised some observations on what makes for effective social sharing material:  
To be effectively shareable on social media, a campaign/action should follow the NUDES approach:

- Networked. e.g. social nomination mechanic.
- Unexpected.
- Dumb. Be easy to understand.
- Exhibited. Involve a shareable behavior. Make it aspirational.
- Stories. Enable or include stories?

This innovation was something new and untested. Charities tend to want to minimise risk by following the successful actions of other organisations.  
But that aversion to risk holds charities back from innovating.

WWF encountered problems while innovatingâ€¦

> Measuring emoji use was a challenge, as no-none of the monitoring systems were capable of this at the time [#nfptweetup](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nfptweetup?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

â€¦ but were able to overcome these because of pro bono support. Had the additional unanticipated costs of innovation not been borne by a third party, how different would this case study have been?
