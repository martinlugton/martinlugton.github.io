Visitors expect your website to load quickly, and will leave if you make them wait too long. People will leave in a matter of seconds, and fractions of a second are significant here. Designing an attractive and usable website is important, but its performance shapes how it is used in practice. If visitors don’t even load your page, there’s no chance of them converting, and this reduction in conversions hurts your profitability. Taking a positive view of this behaviour, there’s an opportunity to increase conversions simply by improving your page speed.

### How to test and improve page speed

To see how fast your pages load, go to [gtmetrix.com](http://gtmetrix.com/) or [webpagetest.org](http://www.webpagetest.org/) and plug in your URL (or a competitor’s ;)). GTMetrix uses insights from Yahoo and Google’s separate page speed testing tools, and draws from their banks of improvement recommendations.

These free services will provide recommendations for how a developer could improve your site’s performance. Things like compressing images, making effective use of browser caching of static assets, and optimising the critical rendering path.
