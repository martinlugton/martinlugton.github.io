# A 10 tweet summary of NFP tweetup 30

*After a short hiatus, the [NFP tweetup](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/nfptweetup-30-9-june-2016-tickets-25771964640) has returned – this time held at JustGiving’s offices. Here are ten particularly illuminating tweets from the event:*

### @LucyCaldicott & @Skipinder set up a Facebook group for fundraising discussion

They’ve found it helpful to extend their network.

> 3. Take yourself out of your own little circle. Go speak to others outside your organisation or outside your area [#nfptweetup](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nfptweetup?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Recently I attended an event for digital project managers. Most attendees were definitely not in the charity sector. Hearing quite different perspectives – and different acronyms and terminology – was refreshing and illuminating.

The group set up by @LucyCaldicott & @Skipinder is self-organising and non-hierarchical

Modbods is another recommended self-organising digital community. It’s on Google+ and is focused on community management:

### @charlotte_cox worked to move somewhereto_ from charity to self-sustaining social enterprise

They had to work on selling their core offer to customers. Potential customers weren’t actually interested in their core vision/mission, so they had to package things differently.
They’ve boiled their key message down to: “Rent space from us, support creative young people”. (Or, to actually quote their website: “Find and book the perfect space to pursue your ideas and ambitions while giving a young person the chance to pursue theirs.”)

### Tips on event social media from @dansmythphoto of @TeenageCancer

Covering a live event on social media doesn’t need to entail incessant posting of content:

> Love the learning of "you are excited, you want to spam everyone but actually that tends to switch people off" [#nfptweetup](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nfptweetup?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
> — Amy J France (@MrsAJFrance) [June 9, 2016](https://twitter.com/MrsAJFrance/status/740972516601135104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Facebook will penalise you for sharing too much similar content.

> Learnings: 'Video is awesome, but have to be sensible with it': FB downgrades similar content. Dedicate resource to find stories [#NFPtweetup](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFPtweetup?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

It’s not always sufficient to just share supporter videos. You need to invest in editing them:

> Dan says, they'd learned it's not enough just to post supporters' videos. They invested in editing to create watchable content [#NFPtweetup](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFPtweetup?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Teenage Cancer Trust re-cut their longer videos to appropriate length for social.
Don’t just cross-post your video on all the different social networks: adapt your content for each.
If you want to share a video on social, make it shorter, and make it work with no sound.

### Just Giving’s #poweredbypeople campaign at the London Marathon

Just Giving created fundraisers a [personalised page that they could share with their friends](https://poweredbypeople.justgiving.com/). It showed how much they’d raised, and pulled in information on their cause.

“People like presents more than asks.”

> The videos were 'a gift' to fundraisers and didn't appear like an ask to their friends – which really worked [#NFPtweetup](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFPtweetup?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Also, snapchat filters are apparently quite cost-effective at the moment, with a good ROI.
